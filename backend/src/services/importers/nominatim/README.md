# Nominatim

Nominatim uses OpenStreetMap data to find locations on Earth by name and address (geocoding). It can also do the reverse, find an address for any location on the planet.

Their API is free to use and we use it to query information about the places you visit. It's important to note that by using it technically the people that maintain their servers will have requests with location information for every location imported in the system.
