# Utils

Everything that I use as utility for this project.

### Export-sql

Small script that automatically runs a `.sql` file and exports the data in a way that I can easily visualize it in
QGis. Useful for example if I want to verify if the locations that failed to reverse geocode were indeed all in the
middle of the ocean. Or if the locations are properly linking to places of interest
